# DateAuthSheetsFlutterTest

A **Flutter test project** exploring date pickers and authentication sheet UI components.

This repository is a sandbox for playing with:
- Flutter date selection widgets
- Authentication / modal sheets
- UI layouts and flows
- Input validation and state handling

It’s meant as a practical experiment for learning and prototyping UI patterns — not a full app.

## What This Is

This project shows how to:
- Show a date picker
- Handle auth/login sheets
- Combine interactive widgets with stateful UI

It’s ideal as:
- A reference for Flutter UI patterns
- A starting point for real apps
- A way to test behavior on multiple platforms****
