# DateAuthSheetsFlutterTest

A **Flutter app using Google Sheets as a backend** to log and display dates — essentially a **calendar with authentication/data storage**.

Instead of a traditional database, this project stores events or date entries in a Google Sheet, letting you read and write entries directly from Flutter.

## Features

- Date picker / calendar UI in Flutter  
- Authenticate or identify users (optional)  
- Store selected dates and associated data in a Google Sheet  
- Real-time updates: read/write entries from the sheet  
- Works on mobile, web, or desktop (Flutter-supported platforms)  

## How It Works

- The app presents a **calendar or date picker UI**  
- Users select a date or range  
- Selected dates are sent to a Google Sheet via API or public access  
- Flutter reads the sheet and displays all logged dates  

Think of it as a lightweight, sheet-based scheduling system built in Flutter.
